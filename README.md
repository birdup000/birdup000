## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working on various UIs and SDKs for AGiXT, an AI Automation Platform developed by [JoshXT](https://github.com/Josh-XT/AGiXT). I'm also developing multiple programs that interact with AGiXT to help aid with ADHD.

AGiXT is a dynamic platform that orchestrates efficient AI instruction management and task execution across multiple providers. It combines adaptive memory, smart features, and a versatile plugin system to enhance AI's understanding and responsiveness, transforming the interaction between users and AI.

With a commitment to innovation, I'm dedicated to pushing the boundaries of AI and bringing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) closer to reality. My ADHD-related programs aim to leverage the capabilities of AGiXT to provide tools and solutions that can assist individuals with ADHD in their daily lives.


What programming languages do I work with? That's a great question - the truth is, I enjoy coding in a wide variety of mainstream languages. While I don't have a single 'go-to' language, the ones that tend to show up most often in my GitHub repositories include...
